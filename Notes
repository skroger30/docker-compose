ðŸ”¹ What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers ensure that the application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, and production).

ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Need Docker?
âœ… Portability â€“ Runs the same on any system (Windows, Linux, macOS).
âœ… Isolation â€“ Each container has its own dependencies, preventing conflicts.
âœ… Scalability â€“ Easily scale applications by running multiple containers.
âœ… Efficiency â€“ Uses less memory and starts faster than virtual machines.

ðŸ”¹ What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool to define and manage multi-container applications using a docker-compose.yml file. Instead of running multiple docker run commands, Compose lets you start all services with one command.

ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Need Docker Compose?
âœ… Simplifies Multi-Container Management â€“ Run database, backend, and frontend together.
âœ… Easy Configuration â€“ Define everything in docker-compose.yml.
âœ… Dependency Management â€“ Ensure services start in the correct order (depends_on).
âœ… One-Command Deployment â€“ Start everything with docker-compose up.

In short, Docker makes applications portable and efficient, while Docker Compose helps manage multi-container applications easily. ðŸš€
